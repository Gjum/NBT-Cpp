The NbtTag class is a class to load and print NBT files.

The main.cpp program is a simple program which takes a compressed or uncompressed NBT file as input and prints out the contents in a json-like format.

From Notch's original spec:
> NBT (Named Binary Tag) is a tag based binary format designed to carry large amounts of binary data with smaller amounts of additional data.
